## About SOMA

FedPy allows you to quickly grab data on the Federal Reserve's System Open Market Account (SOMA), which contains dollar denominated assets acquired through open market operations. These securities serve several purposes like:

- collateral for U.S. currency in circulation and other liabilities on the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet;
- a tool for the Federal Reserve’s management of reserve balances; and
- a tool for achieving the Federal Reserve’s macroeconomic objectives.

The data goes very in depth to see each and every holding by CUSIP, and includes U.S Treasuries, TIPS, CMBS, MBS, Agency Debts, and FRN.
